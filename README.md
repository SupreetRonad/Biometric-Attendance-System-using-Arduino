# Biometric-Attendance-System-using-Arduino
Here, we have built a Biometric attendance system using Arduino that scans for finger print and on successful identification of the person it will log the information of the person to a local file or simply an Excel file. This information can then be accessed easily from opening the file in which the data is stored and making it available for the required authorities to view and analyze information without having any direct physical access to the hardware. 

Components : 
1. Arduino Uno
2. GT511C3 Fingerprint Sensor
3. 10k, 20k, 200 ohms resistors
4. Push button 
5. LED
6. Jump wires
7. Breadboard

For further Information about implementation and running, refer the Final Report.
